## NestJS Starter Kit [v2]

## Installation

Note: when using docker, all the `npm` commands can also be performed using `./scripts/npm` (for example `./scripts/npm install`).
This script allows you to run the same commands inside the same environment and versions than the service, without relying on what is installed on the host.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Create a `.env` file from the template `.env.template` file.

Generate public and private key pair for jwt authentication:

### With docker

Run this command:

```bash
./scripts/generate-jwt-keys
```

It will output something like this. You only need to add it to your `.env` file.

```
To setup the JWT keys, please add the following values to your .env file:
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64="(long base64 content)"
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64="(long base64 content)"
```

### Without docker

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f jwtRS256.key
# Don't add passphrase
$ openssl rsa -in jwtRS256.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwtRS256.key.pub
```

You may save these key files in `./local` directory as it is ignored in git.

Encode keys to base64:

```bash
$ base64 -i local/jwtRS256.key

$ base64 -i local/jwtRS256.key.pub
```

Must enter the base64 of the key files in `.env`:

```bash
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64=BASE64_OF_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64=BASE64_OF_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Running the app

We can run the project with or without docker.

### Local

To run the server without Docker we need this pre-requisite:

- MySQL server running

Commands:

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

### Docker

```bash
# build image
$ docker build -t my-app .

# run container from image
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --volume 'pwd':/usr/src/app --network --env-file .env my-app

# run using docker compose
$ docker compose up
```

Learn more about Docker conventions [here](https://github.com/monstar-lab-group/nodejs-backend/blob/master/architecture/docker-ready.md). (WIP - Currently this is an internal org link.)

Apple M1 users please append `MYSQL_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` to your `.env` file. This is a workaround as MySQL docker images still doesn't support arm64 operating systems.

## Test
